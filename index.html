        <h1>February 1693, Massachusetts</h2>

  <p>The wind howled through the skeletal trees, rattling the beams of the Thatcher homestead like a dying breath. It slipped through the cracks in the wood, a thin and hungry thing, curling around Elias Thatcher’s ankles as he sat at the edge of his bed, staring into the dark. His bones ached—not just from the cold, but from something deeper. Something marrow-deep.</p>

        <p>Margaret was gone.</p>

        <p>He saw it every time he closed his eyes—the way the villagers had come, bristling with fear and righteousness, their breath steaming in the frigid night. Thomas Greaves had led them, his face red with grief, spitting accusations through clenched teeth.</p>

        <p><i>"She cursed my daughter!" Someone toward the back of the mob spat. "She whispered her name in the night, and now the girl is dead." There was shouting and the crowd began to move.</i></p>

        <p>It hadn’t mattered what Margaret said. Hell, she barely spoke at all. The townsfolk had already made up their minds, and all Elias could do was watch as they dragged her toward the lake. She hadn’t fought. Hadn’t screamed. She’d just looked at him, her dark eyes steady, as Greaves’s axe came down on the ice below her and the stones began to fly.</p>

        <p>The axes crack had echoed through the trees. The black water below had yawned open. And then they shoved her in. She vanished. No thrashing. No final, desperate plea. The lake swallowed her whole, and the stones followed.</p>

        <p>The mob waited, ready to launch another assault. If she floated, she was a witch. If she sank, she was innocent. Elias didn’t know how long he knelt there after they left, his knees buried in the snow, his hands numb. He whispered her name, voice cracking. She didn’t answer. Silence followed.</p>

        <p>The mod quickly and quietly dispursed, and when the cold finally took him, dragging him under into something dark and dreamless, it felt almost like relief. How could this happened to his beloved Margaret. How could his neighbors be so cruel.</p>

        <p>In the morning—oh, God, in the morning—things were different. The lake was smooth. Undisturbed. The hole in the ice had sealed over in the night as if it had never been there at all.</p>

        <p>And then he saw...the footprints.</p>

        <p>Bare. Wet. Leading from the lake toward the house.</p>

        <p>He tried to tell himself they weren’t hers. Maybe a hunter had passed through in the night, though no one in their right mind would walk barefoot in the snow. Maybe some poor beast had wandered too close and stumbled, though what kind of animal walked on two legs, toes pressed deep into the frost? Maybe—maybe—</p>

        <p>Then he found the axe.</p>

        <p>The one Greaves had used to break the ice. He’d left it there, abandoned in grief, too sick at heart to bother with it. But now it was propped against the wall of the house, the blade clean. No ice. No frost. As if it had never touched the lake at all.</p>

        <p>And then came the smell.</p>

        <p>It slithered into the house on the second night, thick and wet, like something had crawled up from the earth and died under the floorboards. It filled his lungs, made the walls seem closer, like they were holding their breath. Elias burned sage. He left the windows open. The smell only deepened, like damp rot curling around the edges of his mind.</p>

        <p>And then came the dreams.</p>

        <p>Black water. Margaret’s eyes staring up from beneath the ice. Her lips moving, soundless, her mouth filling with dark water. And something else—something behind her. Something vast and coiling, a shape that wasn’t quite there, wasn’t quite real, but filled his gut with a crawling, gnawing fear.</p>

        <p>Each time, he woke choking on air too thick, too damp, like the lake had followed him out of the dream.</p>

        <p>And on the third night, he woke to something worse.</p>

        <p>Breathing.</p>

        <p>Not his own.</p>

        <p>Slow. Steady. Too warm.</p>

        <p>His gut clenched. The smell was thick in the room, damp earth and cold water. He turned his head.</p>

        <p>And there, beside him, lay Margaret.</p>

        <p>Her hair was still dark, still soft, spilling over the pillow in waves. Her face was the same, untouched by the grave. And yet, Elias felt something inside him recoil, some deep, wordless part of him screaming, <i>No. This is not her.</i></p>

        <p>But God help him, he wanted it to be.</p>

        <p>She stretched lazily, blinking at him with sleep-soft eyes. “What’s wrong, love?” she murmured, voice thick and warm.</p>

        <p>He couldn’t speak. Her fingers found his arm, curling there. They were too warm. Fever-hot.</p>

        <p>“I…” His throat was dry. “I saw them drown you.”</p>

        <p>Margaret laughed softly, shaking her head. “Oh, Elias. You always dream too much.”</p>

        <p>Then she curled against him, sighing contentedly. Within moments, she was asleep again.</p>

        <p>But Elias lay awake. Listening. Waiting. And by dawn, he had made his decision.</p>

        <p>He had to take her back to the lake.</p>

        <p>They walked together in the early morning light, her fingers laced through his. She hummed under her breath, a tune he didn’t recognize...</p>

        <p>...</p>

        <p>And the last thing he saw before the dark took him was Margaret.</p>

        <p>Smiling.</p>

        <p>Still hungry.</p>
